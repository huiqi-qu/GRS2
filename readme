Input requirements (with the 1kg data as the example):
   1kg imputed
   In plink ped/map format
     Extract the variants listed in the file ‘snp_list.txt’ the ‘tables’ directory
  	This step is skippable but the calculation will take longer
     Should contain all of the SNPs listed in the file ‘snp_list.txt’ the ‘tables’ directory

Running the program:
Package requirements:
   Pandas, numpy
   Python 3.9
      Developed with python 3.9 
   The code is really simple: you can potentially replace the pandas and numpy requirements with your own code
Python3 calculate.py -p <plink file prefix> -t <path to all the snp tables> -o <output file>
Given plink file set to_check_grs.ped and to_check_grs.map: to calculate the GRS score
Python3 calculate.py -p to_check_grs -t ./tables/ -o score.txt


## The TOPMed tables should be used as decribed in this article (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34997821/).
